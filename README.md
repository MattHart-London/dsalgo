Simple Data structures and algorithms.

Java
I used https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart/ to produce a basic Maven project that IntelliJ IDEA will accept.

Ideas for other Java classes, in no particular order as they say on Eurovision:
* Perceptron - There's some useful background here https://developer.ibm.com/articles/cc-cognitive-neural-networks-deep-dive/
* Secure Websocket with some kind of simple AI chatbot sitting at one end of the "pipe"
* A variety of node trees: balanced, (un)sorted. Plus red/black binary tree.
* A variety of simple sort algos .. heapsort, quicksort, bubblesort etc
* Bill Pugh's singleton pattern
* Some simple class loader of my own, so I fully understand how it all stacks up.
* Futures and promises, and a sounder understanding of concurrency options in Java.
* Annotations and meta-programming in Java.
* Decipher git files
* A lock-free container such as a stack, maybe I use a ring-buffer for this aka LMAX ideas.

Bash
* Write a simple docker like implementation using bash scripts.

* C/C++
* An async webserver in C and then the same thing using C++ ASIO.
